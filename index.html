		<p>Hi! I am Salma and I'm a 14 years old Tunisian girl that lives in La Marsa. I've attended Taieb el Mhiri public primary school Then I passed the "sixième" and got into Collège Pilote les Berges Du Lac and then again I got into another pioneer school in which I'm currently studying "Lycéé pilote Ariana". Alsooo, I've no idea what job I want but what I know is that I'm never becoming a teacher as well as a doctor (cauz I hate those jobs. No offence.) aaaand yea I'm getting into unnecessary information so bye :)</p>

			<p>You may be wondering "how can this nerdy girl have any talents?" Well nope! I do have some, like sleeping more than 15 hours and still wake up tired, tagging mybest friend in memes and jokes all day long, spend +5 hours on Instagram; sleeping again... Oh! And i also do dance and volleyball and play guitar in a music team that won so many competitions but these aren't as important as the previous talents :)</p>
